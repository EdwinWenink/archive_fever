  Thanks for this walkthrough! Had some issues with permissions in the root
  folder area on my Kobo Libra H20 but by making a copy of Kobo eReader.conf on
  my desktop, making the edits and then dragging it into the Kobo and replacing
  the file this seems to have worked! No idea why this isn't a default
  feature... Might look at your python options too because I also love Python.
