  I'm still very happy with the Kobo, so I can wholeheartedly recommend it. The
  script above is really just a first sketch. One major problem is that it
  doesn't handle errors at all. So if a particular field is not found, it just
  crashes. I redid this a little bit more properly and also added some more
  formatting for the markdown output. I didn't spend much time on it though, so
  it's not necessarily code I would publish. What I would also add is the option
  to process all notes in batch (also didn't do that yet). I could make a
  repository with what I have so far, you could take that as a point of
  departure. TLDR; the code above is a starting point that you could use for
  your own project, if your goal is also to learn a bit of Python. Otherwise I
  could share my code with you. I'll perhaps later make a follow-up post when I
  have something that's worth publishing, but I'm currently a bit short on time
  :-)
