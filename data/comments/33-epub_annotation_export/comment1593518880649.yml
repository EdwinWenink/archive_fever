  Glad to hear! I don't know why exactly, but my own script has stopped working
  for me a while back. Since then I added some more logic to handle failures and
  missing fields (I noticed the quality of epubs can differ quite a bit w.r.t.
  specifying meta data etc.). Also added some logic for sorting the entries. If
  you find an issue, feel free to hit me up! I can always share the updated
  script via email, but if there's interest I may write a post with an update
  :-)
