body: "Hi Edwin, \r\nI'm not literate in Python so don't really get what I have to do once I've downloaded the file. Is it something that changes all .txt files exported after they are exported or is it something we have to run for each .txt files once it's in our computer. Could you have a dummy-level tutorial that would make people like me (and my dad, who loves to annotate but always find this hard to read the raw txt) understand and proceed ?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for working on this ! I don't understand how it's not on the Kobo by default (what good are notes if you can't use them ? People doing this are generally writing theses or articles and want useful info like pagenumber and such :/)\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nJordy"
