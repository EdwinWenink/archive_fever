body: "Interesting article Edwin. It’s been a while since I’ve done any reading of (primary) materials in the field of jurisprudence (which I have done too little of anyway to speak with any authority on the subject), but your post made me think about some central questions in relation to “rule of law” which could also be raised in respect of “rule by AI”.\r\n\r\nWhy do we obey the law? Is there necessarily a link between law and morality? Are laws just orders backed by threats (in the case of regulation of behaviour by AI, probably yes)? Would laws developed and enforced by AI satisfy Hart’s “rule of recognition” (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_recognition)?\r\n\r\nI would be interested to hear your views on how legitimacy could be conferred on law developed and enforced through AI. Some first thoughts I had are that such AI-law is based on human behaviour as its “input” in the same way that law derives its legitimacy from a democratic legislative process (at least in our society, for now).\r\n\r\nP.S. I would like to compliment you on your clear and entertaining writing style."
