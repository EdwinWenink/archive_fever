  Glad to hear it was useful! I'm afraid it's really intended behavior to record
  incoming messages in INBOX and outgoing messages in SENT. Because people
  usually include the message they respond to in the reply itself, you
  effectively also have your own outgoing message in the inbox when the reply
  comes in. I did a quick Google search and only found [ugly
  hacks](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/131529/how-can-i-configure-mutt-to-display-my-replies-within-threads).
  If you somehow would configure server side that sent messages stay in your own
  inbox, that would of course work... but I can't imagine any service supporting
  this. I'm also curious if you know of any other client doing this :-)
