  I'm aware of that but currently do not have time to fix it. The reason is that
  I never bothered to write css for the style of this comment box, so it uses
  whatever theme you have in your browser. In my case that is actually a dark
  color, so I did not notice this issue immediately, but for most people that is
  a *very white* text box, which indeed is ugly for the dark theme. I will fix
  it when I have time, but thanks for the feedback! Always appreciated.
