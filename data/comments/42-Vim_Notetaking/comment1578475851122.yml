body: "Your code looks good! The simplest explanation is that you do not have ripgrep installed on your system or, alternatively, that for some reason Vim cannot find it (but if you can find it from your terminal, Vim should find it). That would explain the error because the default grep command does not have the '-g' option. I see that I did not make it clear enough that the `rg` command is something you should install separately on your system. I did not provide the installation step because it is slightly different for different Linux distributions. I would do `sudo pacman -S ripgrep` and you should probably type `sudo apt-get install ripgrep`. \r\n\r\n1. Can you check if you have ripgrep installed by opening a terminal and typing `rg`. Does it tell you something like \"command not found\"\r\n2. If not, can you type in Vim `:set grepprg?` ? This is the way you check how your variable is set in Vim.  I suspect yours will now mention regular `grep` and not `rg`. This is because, if my hunch is correct, your `grepprg` is only set correctly when `rg` exists on your system, due to the `if executable('rg')` condition. \r\n\r\nHopefully that's it, because that's a 15 second fix. Your questions really show me where I could be more clear in the post, so I'll update  the post with a clear remark about installation of `ripgrep`. \r\n\r\nLet me know if that works out!"
