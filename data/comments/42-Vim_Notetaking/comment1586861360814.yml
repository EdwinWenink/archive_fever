body: "Hi Edwin! First of all many thanks for your kind reply and my apologies for the double-post. I got an error-message the first time - so I posted again...\r\n\r\nI played around with the index-file, the command \"gf\" was new to me, so I was impressed, how things working.\r\n\r\nMy only question here is: your index file is linked to certain subfolders (or directories) and not to certain \"documents\" is that right? That's why you implemented the tree structure - I guess?\r\n\r\nBTW: I just set up a minimalistic system, which I can sync via \"Syncthing\" to my smartphone. There I have installed an app called Markor, which can read and edit all the files. Great stuff :-)."
