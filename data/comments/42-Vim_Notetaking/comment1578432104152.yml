body: "Awesome, good to hear! \r\nYeah working with buffers was an eye-opener for me. You can leave multiple files open and switch quickly between them, without the need to clutter your screen with many windows. \r\n\r\nW.r.t. your first point: that's correct, the point of CtrlP is only to easily find files and not to search the contents of those files. For searching through the content of the file you should use the \"Ngrep\" function. Grep is a standard UNIX tool for searching the contents of files line by line, and the only goal of the Ngrep command mentioned in this post is to specify that we only care about our notes directory. \r\n\r\nYour second point is not about the fuzzy file finder CtrlP right? I assume you use `\\n` for the Ngrep command right, so to search the contents of your files? (Btw. I updated that mapping so now I use `\\nn` because I wanted to use n as a prefix for all other \"notes\" commands.) \r\n\r\nMy first reaction is that maybe there is nothing wrong and that you simply search for a pattern that does not exist. Is \"<Hadfdasdfadsfllo>\" what you typed in as a search pattern? Can you try if the command works when searching for a pattern that for sure exists in your notes?\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't work, can you give an example of 1) the line in your .vimrc where you define the relevant command and then 2) what you type in when using the mapping? Then I can hopefully help you better :-)"
