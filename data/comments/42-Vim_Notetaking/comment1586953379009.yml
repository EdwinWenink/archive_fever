  Hi Edwin! Again many thanks for your kind answer, now everything is clear to
  me. So this system is great and I also like the index page very much. The
  Zettelkastensystem seems a good approach here. I will give it a go for a
  while. Looking very forward, reading more of your fine articles here. Thanks a
  million for all the help and take care!
