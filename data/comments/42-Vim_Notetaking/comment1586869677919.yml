body: "Hi Peter! Yeah I received all five of your comments :-) My comment setup is a complete hack, because your comments are actually sent to a raspberry pi. \r\nI'm glad to hear you like it! With respect to your question: in the tree displayed in this post you can actually run `gf` and `gF` both on files and directories. Using it on a directory will just open Vim's file explorer, called \"netrw\" (you can also access it with \":Explore\", by the way).\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I've almost immediately moved away from using the tree. It just looked cool, but it quickly gets unmanageable. Relying on directory structure forces you to categorize notes rather than relying on search tools and direct interlinking. I've switched to a \"Zettelkasten\" approach.\r\n\r\nHowever, the idea of an index page is alive and kicking! You can always insert links to heavily used project notes. I currently use a page with all my tags as my index page (for tags, see the next post). I maintain that page automatically with a Python script that I have not published yet. It works great for me but I haven't published it yet because it's an ongoing project :-). Because there's so much interest recently I should really start working on publishing it though."
