  My pleasure! Otternaut (directly above) asked practically the same question,
  so reading through my response to him should help you. In short: 1) type the
  name of the file you want to link to, 2) use `gf` and `gF` in Vim (normal
  mode) to open that file. The only assumption this makes is that your working
  directory is set up correctly. The easiest solution is to make sure that the
  working directory is the root directory of all your notes :-). Check with
  `:pwd` and use `:cd` to change the working directory. Feel free to let me know
  if you encounter issues ;-).
