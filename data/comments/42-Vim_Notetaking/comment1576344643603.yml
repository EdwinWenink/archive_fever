body: "Ha Edwin,\r\n\r\nAnother great post. I am slowly getting enthusiastic about VIM thanks to you. As much of the information here is new to me, I may have read over it in the text, but is there a way to see what other files link to a specific file? For example, if I were to implement your ideas here, could I get an overview of the files in which I make a reference to my notes on the 'Human Condition'? \r\n\r\nBoris"
