body: "I am implementing your setup at the moment and as a beginner I have three questions:\r\n\r\n1) How did you create the initial index file, before you print the more elaborate tree structure? Did you just type this manually?\r\n2) I think the command has to be \":!.tree [etc]\" instead of \":.!tree [etc]\". Could that be true?\r\n3) Do you need to enter this command manually every time you open the index file or is there a way to automatize this?"
