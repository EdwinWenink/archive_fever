body: "Thanks!\r\nYou did not read over it. After writing this post, I actually implemented that feature :-)! It's on the backlog for another post. What you are asking for is what is technically called a \"reverse index\" for hyperlinks. A regular index would be that for each document you save all files it links to, which is simple because you only need to look at the current file. A reverse index is a little bit trickier, because you want to look over all your other notes to see if they link to your current notes, in your case on Hannah Arendt. \r\nFor now I wrote a quick Python script to do that. The cool thing about Vim is that you can quickly call that external script to make the index *without leaving Vim*. For now I let it output all backreferences in a JSON format and then have a function in Vim to find the references to the current file. \r\n\r\nFor example, if I'm currently checking out my notes on Stiegler's introduction to Automatic Society 1, I run my function and Vim will show me a buffer with this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"Philosophy/Stiegler-Automatic_Society_1_introduction.md\": [\r\n        \"./Zettelkasten/automation_index.md\",\r\n        \"./Zettelkasten/data_without_theory.md\",\r\n        \"./Zettelkasten/hermeneutic_digital_technology.md\",\r\n        \"./Zettelkasten/maffia_capitalism.md\",\r\n        \"./Zettelkasten/work_vs_labour.md\"\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you do `gF` on any of those filenames, you jump to the correct file :-)! They all contain a link to the file I was currently editing.\r\n\r\nThis was just a prototype. It works, but I want to get rid of the python dependency, ideally. I'll keep you posted. If you can't wait for the next post, you can always hit me up ;-)"
