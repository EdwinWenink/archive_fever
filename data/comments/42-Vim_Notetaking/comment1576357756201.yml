  Actually, if you do not use Vim but you *do* have all your notes in Markdown,
  my Python script would maybe be handy for you as a standalone. It currently
  makes an index of all tags, an index of all files belonging to each tag, and
  the reverse index that tells you which files link back to a given file. Tags
  are simply indicated like @philosophy, and I wrote code to recognize Markdown
  links in your notes (but not images etc.).
