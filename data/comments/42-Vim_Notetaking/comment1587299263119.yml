body: "Hi Peter, yes there is :-) (and if there wouldn't be, we could figure out how to write exactly what you want without too much effort). If I understand you correctly, Ctrl-W f should do exactly what you want. This will open the file under your cursor, but then in a horizontal split. By the way, somewhat ironically opening it vertically is a regular horizontal split, and opening it side by side is a vertical split. If you happen to know the filename by heart, you can also open files in splits using `:sp[lit] filename` and `:vs[plit] filename`, where the parts between brackets are optional (i.e. you can abbreviate the commands).  \r\n\r\nThe Ctrl-W prefix is not as elegant as some other Vim commands, but it's still mnemonic, because the W stands for Window, and this prefix is used for all window-related commands. If you feel adventurous, you can explore a bit further with `:help Ctrl-W`.\n I'm glad to hear you are enjoying it! :-)"
