  Haha, now we finally get to the important stuff: squabbling about markdown
  syntax! There is no such thing as "the" ultimate specification of Markdown, as
  there are a lot of flavours, so I'm not sure what specification you are
  referring to. Perhaps something John Gruber wrote, since your Haskell
  scripting betrays you are pretty hardcore, but otherwise my guess would be you
  are mostly using GitHub flavoured markdown. I pretty much daily use
  pandoc-markdown myself. But notice that a complete blank line is needed to
  separate paragraphs, and that therefore a '*' without a preceding blank line
  is by most markdown flavours recognized as being part of the preceding
  paragaph, i.e. regular text. [Check this link for an example of the
  difference](https://github.com/gjtorikian/markdowntutorial.com/issues/46), or 
  [consider this standard example on
  Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). But you don't have to
  believe me, try it out for yourself ;-)
