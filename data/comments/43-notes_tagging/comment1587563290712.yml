  Thanks for pointing this out! I do have vim-pandoc installed but never relied
  on its bibliography functionality. When I need that kind of functionality I
  usually switch to writing in LaTeX directly. I might check it out in the
  future though and now I can anticipate this potential issue thanks to you.
