body: "Hello, nice post, thanks.\r\n\r\nAs for Xavi, universal ctags didn't work for me.  An issue with \\w and \\S which weren't recognized. And even then, the multitag per line didn't work. But looking at the doc, i don't know why it works for you, it shouldn't. Maybe a difference in ctags from the december version as of today (april) ? I did, however, managed to make it work (not using the \\w and \\S characters, and using recursion by re-entering the toplevel parser):\r\n\r\n```--langdef=mdtags\r\n--languages=mdtags\r\n--langmap=mdtags:.md\r\n--kinddef-mdtags=t,tag,tags\r\n--_tabledef-mdtags=toplevel\r\n--_mtable-regex-mdtags=toplevel/(^|[[:space:]])@([a-zA-Z0-9][^[:space:]]*)/\\2/t/{mgroup=1}{tenter=toplevel}\r\n--_mtable-regex-mdtags=toplevel/.//```\r\n\r\nI am using universal ctags v0.0.0(7a924d77),on macosx.\r\n\r\nHope this helps"
