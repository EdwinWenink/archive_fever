body: "Thanks a lot for checking in again! I really wouldn't have been aware of this issue if it weren't for you, and I know for a fact you helped others, so hats off to that. I indeed see the confusion I may have caused with the word \"experimental\". In the recent doc the mline option is presented as \"new\" but not as \"experimental\". It is however discussed more or less in one breath with the experimental \"_mtable\" feature, and all further flags apply to both; that's where I conflated them. \r\n\r\nAnyways, you are absolutely right that the regex itself matches only once. The trick is that using `mline-regex-markdowntags` switches from the regular line based approach to a file-based approach. I have no clue about the internals and didn't question them further as it got the job done for me. The doc on `mline` says: \r\n\r\n> This flag indicates the pattern should be applied to the whole file contents, not line by line. N is the number of a capture group in the pattern, which is used to record the line number location of the tag. In the above example 3 is specified. The start position of the regex capture group 3, relative to the whole file is used.\r\n\r\nHowever, the doc also says that you must specify the mgroup variable. I just did some testing, and things still seem to work even if I delete that. So either it defaults to zero without the documentation saying so, or its... MAGIC. In any case, your solution still seems to be more systematic and the `{_advanceTo=N[start|end]}` is logically more transparent. So I hope this feature will get out of its experimental phase soon :-)!\r\nFor now, I refer Mac users to your solution (see the UPDATE in the blog post)."
