  Thanks a lot for your useful response! I actually received another mail today
  from someone on MacOS encountering issues with my setup, that I could not
  reproduce. When I have time I'll update my universal ctags version to the most
  recent build and do some testing. If that doesn't cause the issue, I might
  look into why specifically people on MacOS seem to be having issues (I only
  tested on Linux and Windows). In any case, great that you already found a fix
  and thanks a lot for sharing! :-)
