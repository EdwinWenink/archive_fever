It's a fun read. \r\n\r\nThis sentence struck me: \r\n\r\n> As the machines we use are getting more intelligent and more like living beings everyone in society is at some point going to have to change the way they regard them and I like to believe that the mechanical slave discussion is an early sign of the beginning of that process.\r\n\r\nI think there's a fundamental point of interest hidden in there, namely:\r\ndo you think we will (or will have to) treat machines different because they will *really be* more intelligent, or do you think this is simply due to the anthropomorphizing attitudes of humans when they see something resembling intelligent behaviour?  \r\n\r\nI know that's a big question, but I think it could be a direction for future thought if you are interested in that sort of topic."
