body: "Great reply! You raise interesting points.\r\n\r\nMedical data is a story of its own and I'm not a professional, but here are my initial thoughts:\r\n\r\nIt is indeed hard to fully predict in advance the specific details of how data will be used in retrospective analysis. But if there is initial patient-doctor contact where a patient consents to their data being used for research, then at least it is clear to me that those future uses have the same underlying purpose as what the data was collected for: furthering medical science. \r\nSo I don't think that's function creep, and I agree with you the main issue there is informed consent.\r\n\r\nThere is an interesting power dynamics there though! The underlying question is always: when is consent *meaningful*? Very ill patients, such as people with cancer that have a serious chance of dying, might consent to a lot more than they would if they were healthy. This makes them extra vulnerable for privacy-related issues.\r\n\r\nNormally genetic data, uniquely identifying biometric data or data concerning health, sex life or sexual orientation cannot be processed at all according to Article 9 of the GDPR. \r\nBut the medical sector is mentioned as a clear exemption to this prohibition here!\r\nIn general, privacy is not an absolute right and is always weighed against other factors that may overrule it. \r\nFor example, normally people have the right to request deletion of their personal data, but in some medical cases this can be overruled if that's in the benefit of public health.\r\nThat's something to be evaluated on a case by case basis, I think.\r\n\r\nAt [this link](https://english.ccmo.nl/investigators/legal-framework-for-medical-scientific-research/laws/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr) I found this clarification w.r.t. consent for medical research:\r\n\r\n> In research within the scope of the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act ( “WMO”) explicit consent is already asked from the subjects for the processing of their personal data in the context of the study. This is done on the basis of a corresponding text in the Subjects Information Form ( “PIF”) and the  informed consent form. This is consent is asked separately from the consent for participation in the study that is required by  the WMO. Consent for the processing of personal data must be explicitly  asked  and is not implied by or can not be derived from the consent for participation in the study.\r\n\r\nThis does indeed assume that you appropriately (pseudo-)anonymize the data. \r\n\r\nWhat *is* an example of contextual integrity are doctors having a peek at patient dossiers while these doctors are in no way involved in the medical treatment. This was actually [in the news](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/07/16/hagaziekenhuis-krijgt-eerste-avg-boete-voor-inzage-in-barbie-dossier-a3967253) this year.\r\n\r\nOne more remark about your idea for an app: that would in my opinion actually make function creep more likely.\r\nA philosopher that currently works in Nijmegen published a worthwhile article on the [Googlization of health research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309141945_The_Googlization_of_health_research_from_disruptive_innovation_to_disruptive_ethics). \r\nUsing apps is a highly effective way of tricking people into given away data about themselves, that can subsequently be used for health research. \r\n[This article](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/12/google-project-nightingale-hospital-data-deal-raises-privacy-fears.html) on the involvement of Google in healthcare was actually published yesterday. [Here](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/business/google-ascension-health-data.html) as well.\r\nGoogle will store health care data of 150 hospitals! Do we trust Google, of all companies, with that sensitive data?\r\nA hot topic!\r\n\r\nHope these thoughts are helpful in the context of your own work!\r\n(Btw... these comments combined are long enough for a new post...)"
