body: "Thank you for the reply Edwin. Interesting thoughts that are definitely reflective on my own work.\r\n\r\nAs a little addendum, I found the following statement in the 'Human Tissue and Medical Research: Code of Conduct for responsible use':\r\n\r\n\"For ‘further use’ in scientific research of coded-anonymous human tissue, an augmented system of 'opt-out’ is deemed acceptable (...) no-objection or opt-out expresses citizenship, namely that participation is a fundamental contribution to results of research becoming available for others. At the same time it leaves enough room to withdraw should the feeling exist that scientific research with human tissue (or data) should not take place.\"\r\n\r\nThis means that as by default, tissue that is left-over from the clinical setting, may always be used for research purposes, since the benefit of the population as a whole should be the concern of every citizen. The opt-out principle allow for user control.\r\n\r\nThis is simalar to what you found in the WMO.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for the interesting subject and our little digression!"
