body: "Interesting subject! I had not heard of the term function creep, although I have been confronted with this topic many times.\r\n\r\nIn cancer medicine (my field of work), patients give consent to perform tests in order to adequately diagnose the cancer type and risk stratification (clinical setting). For instance, this includes imagining like CT- and MRI-scans. After the patients is treated, these scans are preserved for many many years in which they might be used for retrospective research. Also, these images are sometimes used in presentations at symposia.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that I do not know when patients give consent to future research or in what way they are informed (by leaflet? by the physician?). I also feel that simply telling the patient that their images or blood test may be used for research, does not tell them for what cause or what specific research question is addressed. In prospective research, the patient always receives information about the test. \r\n\r\nI think this might be yet another example of function creep. This time, the creep exists because it is so difficult to explain to a patient all the million ways that their data may be used in future studies. If it were possible to fully inform the patient, or the logistical problem of asking a patient whether their data may be used of a retrospective analysis when they are no longer in the hospital can be overcome, then I guess you would say that the data is multifunctional to begin with, rather than speaking of function creep.\r\n\r\nI think this is more a discussion on informed consent than on function creep. Maybe, a query could be send with an app to the individual asking if their data may be used for so an so research, giving the individual user control. This way, a new consent could be given more easily, tackling the logistical problem.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in medicine, the problem of integrity has already started when the researcher approaches the individual since the medical data had to be accessed for selection. How to prevent privacy-invading function creep in this scenario?\r\n\r\nFinally, I also think many physicians consider using data, obtained in the clinical setting, is harmless to the patient when data anonymization is thorough. However, that is a whole different discussion."
