  I get your confusion. What I meant is that there used to be an email service
  that allowed you to get emails for a very specific purpose only, such as merge
  requests. That service is deprecated now. In my general settings I had email
  notifications enabled, but still did not receive any emails... The problem was
  that I had to "watch" my own repository first. That was a bit unintuitive for
  me. TLDR; never mind and thanks for the reply!
