  Sort of! One thing I noticed immediately is that it is a pain to delete all
  branches the bot creates for merge requests manually.  But luckily I could set
  up a webhook on GitHub that asks the staticman bot to remove the branch
  immediately after I merge it, and that seems to work now. A seemingly trivial
  problem I have left is that I do not get email notifications when the bot
  makes a merge request, so users might have to wait a fair bit before their
  comments show up. It seems the regular email service of GitHub is now
  deprecated. Did you ever do something like that with a webhook, or is there an
  easier way?
