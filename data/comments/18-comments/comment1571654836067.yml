body: "Hi, thanks for your reaction! There are some clear downsides to my approach. The only very minimalistic authentication is a captcha. By the time I implemented the comment feature my site did not have that much traffic, but by now it does and I get a spam from bots that know how to pass the captcha. Honestly, there is the option to install a spam filter to be used in combination with Staticman, but I simply did not make time yet to fix it.\r\n\r\nA second thing to note is that these comments generate pull requests on the GitHub repo of this website. I have to approve them before they show up here, which so far has been my way of dealing with spam: I simply close the pull request. By the way, you can inspect all code of my website on that very same GitHub repo :-).\r\n\r\nPhilosophically, the major advantage of my current approach is that users have full anonimity. If I would ask for emails or contact details, those would be recorded in the git history. Nevertheless it would be nice to be able to notify you that I responded to your comment, for example. I don't know how to while preserving the privacy of commenters. The best method for personal contact is... email ;-). There is another option to comment here though with authentication, namely to submit a webmention using the microformats2 system (used by the IndieWeb)."
