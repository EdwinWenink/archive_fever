  Thank you so much for your kind words! I've taken a bit of a hiatus from the
  web this summer, but this comment gets me fired up again! I'm constantly
  changing bits here and there, but by now I've reached a point where I'm quite
  content with the look and feel. The link highlighting is actually relatively
  recent and I'm also happy with it. Even though some things may be a bit rough
  around the edges, I made it myself and that's (imo) what a personal website is
  all about :-)! Be sure to forward/email me the link of your own website once
  it's online!
