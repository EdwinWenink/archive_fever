body: "Hi Paolo,\r\n\r\nThanks for dropping by and leaving a message! \r\nIt is nice to see that you found my post, since it seems we have a quite similar background. I empathize both with your ambition and your struggles: I too started out with Arch Linux without any prior Linux experience. I often got lost, but you'll be surprised how much you will learn over time if you persist.  Luckily, the Arch community is very supportive, and all kinds of manuals can be found here: [on the arch wiki](https://www.archlinux.org/). \r\n\r\nOn your website I see you found your way into Arch Linux through Luke Smith. He is a good guide to cool minimalistic programs, but don't follow everything he says :-) He seems to sometimes pursue minimalism just for the sake of getting to make a new video, e.g. by calling ranger too \"bloated\" (took this example because you also use ranger according to your website). \r\n\r\nWith respect to collaboration and your websites: I received your email and will answer there! Btw: the source of my website is available [here](https://github.com/EdwinWenink/personal_website)."
