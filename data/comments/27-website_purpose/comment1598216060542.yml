I have seen quite a bunch once I got interested in the very idea of personal websites. Yellow highlight, readable and beautiful font, lightweight, fascinate in original link highlighting, dark theme. You are very brilliant and original, really! This is a great source of inspiration, which I will come back when I start my own website too...^^\r\nAnyway, good luck with your goals and I wish you a lot of interesting ideas flowing around on this spot of your personal online land!"
