body: "Well. Let me start by saying that I found your website searching for a way to use Neomutt and PGP. Being myself someone who is interested in Philosophy (I studied at Faculty of Philosophy of Braga, Portugal), although I graduated in Cultural Studies, I'm fond to technology and I want to start my own website within the Indieweb philosophy.My knowledge of computer programming languages is very short and I fight almost all the time with complicated configuration. I love Linux and, lately, I've been able - with the help of some tutorials - to install Archlinux and minimalist programs. If, by any means, I can collaborate for the content of your website, I would be happy. Meanwhile, I am looking to some help on designing and making my own minimalist website. \r\n\r\nB.Regards\r\nPaulo Pinto"
