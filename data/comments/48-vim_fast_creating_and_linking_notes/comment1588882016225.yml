body: "Great! That's cool! It sounds like you are looking for [notational-fzf-vim](https://github.com/alok/notational-fzf-vim). Vimscript can be a hassle by the way. For a less trivial things I tend to switch to Python (you can also use Python from within Vimscript, just so you know). \r\n\r\nIf you have a nice workflow going at some point, I would be glad to hear it!"
