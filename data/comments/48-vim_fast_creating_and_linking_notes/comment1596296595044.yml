body: "Its me again. A couple other things I thought could be helpful. I grabbed this bit of code from a [commit](https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown/pull/9/commits/44dec444c959fa57c2fc835980ad15dbbbf11d1c) to the markdown syntax file that never made it in. You would place this in .vim/after/syntax/markdown.vim. It is a syntax file that turns concealing on for markdown links. So your link would go from this [A.md](202007311200-A.md) to looking like this [A.md]. The stuff inside () is still there of course it is just \"concealed\". When the cursor is in the same line it it would expand out to the full set again, or be revealed. Although if you don't want it displayed at all you could also add, to the code below, setlocal concealcursor=nvic.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsyntax spell toplevel\r\nsetlocal conceallevel=2\r\n\r\nruntime! syntax/html.vim\r\n\r\nsyn region markdownLinkText matchgroup=markdownLinkTextDelimiter start=\"!\\=\\[\\%(\\_[^]]*]\\%( \\=[[(]\\)\\)\\@=\" end=\"\\]\\%( \\=[[(]\\)\\@=\" keepend nextgroup=markdownLink,markdownId skipwhite contains=@markdownInline,markdownLineStart concealends\r\nsyn region markdownLink matchgroup=markdownLinkDelimiter start=\"(\" end=\")\" contains=markdownUrl keepend contained conceal\r\nsyn region markdownId matchgroup=markdownIdDelimiter start=\"\\s*\\[\" end=\"\\]\" keepend contained conceal\r\nsyn region markdownAutomaticLink matchgroup=markdownUrlDelimiter start=\"<\\%(\\w\\+:\\|[[:alnum:]_+-]\\+@\\)\\@=\" end=\">\" keepend oneline concealends\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinal bit you can add this into an ftplugin to change this mapping only for markdown files, or only for you notes directory if you set up an ftdetect. Basically the mapping takes the follow file commands and alters them to move to the next ( and then do the command. This way if your cursor is on a link inside [] it will move to the file inside () and follow that file. This even works if you use the conceal cursor from above and are unable to see the ().\r\n\r\n```\r\nnnoremap <buffer> gf f(gf\r\nnnoremap <buffer> <c-w>f f(<c-w>f\r\n\r\n```"
