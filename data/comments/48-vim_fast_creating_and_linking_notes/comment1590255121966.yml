body: "@nv2lt thanks for your reply and your addition! I personally prefer to not rely on plasticboy/vim-markdown (I like vim-pandoc), but this is a great suggestion for those that prefer to keep nested directories! This again shows the beauty of the Vim-route: everyone can find a way to adjust it to their preferences. \r\n\r\nThanks a lot for dropping by!"
