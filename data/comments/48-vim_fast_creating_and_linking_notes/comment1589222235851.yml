  @Edwin In terms of controlP vs fzf with ripgrep or silver searcher, fzf,
  ripgrep, and silver searchers are command line programs that can be used in
  vim via a wrapper or plugin.  I was already using fzf and silver searcher on
  the command line before I started using it in Vim.  FZF is a Swiss Army Knife
  type of application, I can use it in Vim, to select music for mpd, or many
  other tasks.  I use it because that is what I heard of first and it is so
  versatile.
