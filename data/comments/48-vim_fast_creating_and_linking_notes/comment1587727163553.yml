body: "That's very useful! That's my official debute on stack exchange, by the way, so thanks for that. I've actually meant to mention in the post that this should be easy in fzf as well. This is a great addition, because I know most people prefer fzf. The only reason I do not use fzf for this notetaking system is that I require it to be cross-platform and fzf doesn't work great on Windows. I'll refer to your comment in the post \\U0001F60A.\r\n\r\nJust as a sidenote, one fzf-related thing I'd like to try out (but I didn't yet) is [fzf notational velocity](https://github.com/alok/notational-fzf-vim)."
