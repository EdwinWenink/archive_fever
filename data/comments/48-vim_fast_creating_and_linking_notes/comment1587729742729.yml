body: "Oh and I see I overlooked a question hidden in the code. \"Why only the tail?\". That's actually a better question than you may initially suspect. I've struggled a bit with this and there's multiple layers to my answer. \r\n\r\nFirst the practical answer: for Vim it's not necessary to include the whole (relative) path if you set Vim up this way:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\" Include subfolders\r\nset path+=**\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThis way, Vim will find your file anyways with `gf`, even if the note is in a different folder, assuming you follow the convention I use that your working directory is the root directory of all your notes.\r\n\r\nThe real answer is a bit more intricate, because I additionally want all Markdown links to work when I export all my files as a website, or preview them on GitHub. With your current solution, the link would look like this if I'm not mistaken \"Zettelkasten/somenote.md\". This will work for Vim because your working directory is the root directory of your notes, but it won't for example on GitHub. It would look for Zettelkasten/Zettelkasten/somenote.md . You could fix this by instead using \"../Zettelkasten/somenote.md\", but this will break your linking in Vim! \r\n\r\nTLDR; unless my reasoning is flawed, this will force you into some hybrid linking convention where you'll maintain references relative to your Vim working directory and links that function anywhere, relative to your specific note. You could use the Vim link (just the filename with the path setting from above) as the link description, and the other as the actual link. \r\n\r\nThis all made me commit to the Zettelkasten method because they work with a flat directory anyways, which solved everything. Additionally, having a flat directory makes writing my own tools so much easier."
