body: "@Robert That's great! I have to step up my game now to match the combined effort of all of you! I'm curious where CtrlP will fall short of fzf when it comes to customization. Great minimalistic website, I subscribed to your RSS so I'll be following you (many years ago since I translated some Greek, hey, maybe I pick some up again).\r\n\r\nI am still interested in having this information on my website in a place that is more accessible than the comments, because I think it's a great addition to this post. It would be easier to find for people. It could be a cross-post of your blog @Robert, or a new write-up by @hbenevides. I could try out fzf myself and do it, but since it is a combined effort of all of you, you should take the credit :-)"
