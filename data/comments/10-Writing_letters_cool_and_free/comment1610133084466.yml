body: "Investigators assessed for a composite endpoint of perinatal mortality or \r\nmain neonatal morbidity, defining the neonatal period as \r\nthe time until hospital discharge. Nadav Schwartz, MD, clinical director of outpatient maternal fetal drugs on the Hospital of \r\nthe University in Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, stated that this analysis underscores a \r\nnecessity for additional research about how the placenta functions.\r\n\r\nMichael Goettler, Upjohn's president, will grow to be \r\nViatris CEO, while Ian Read, Pfizer's former CEO and chairman, will come aboard as a director.\r\nLearn will probably be joined by James Kilts, a former CEO of Gillette and VP at Proctor and Gamble,\r\non the board, with Mylan chairman Robert Coury conserving his role at the brand new company.\r\nKilts, a current Pfizer board member, will step down from that seat to take \r\nthe Viatris role, Pfizer mentioned. Read, a 41-year \r\nPfizer veteran, stepped down as Pfizer chairman as part of a \r\ntransition of power to CEO Albert Bourla, who took the reins last January.\r\n\r\n\r\nmy web blog :: [porn](http://www.15488.info/ \"porn\")"
