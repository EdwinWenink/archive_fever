body: "Interesting subject! I really liked the passage by Derrida, especially the sentence on the relationship between earth, terra, territory, and terror. Very poetic!\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, the bottom line of your essay is that because the identity of the aggressor in case of a cyber attack can be obscured, it is difficult to know to whom the aggressors of such attacks are affiliated. The aggressor could on be affiliated to their own beliefs (terrorism) or to a nation (an act of war).\r\n\r\nThis has serious implications on determining who is accountable for an attack, as you described in the insurance claim on the NonPetya attack. In my own words: if you don't know who did it and under which affiliation, how can you make someone or something (in case of a government permitted attack) accountable?\r\n\r\nTo digress from your subject, I presume is already very complicated to determine the accountability of a large scale aggressive attack, even if you do know the identity of the aggressor(s). For example, in the pre-digital era, a dictator (let's say Hitler), could initiate numerous acts of war on a large scale. Some would support him voluntarily, while others were indoctrinated or forced to participate in the war. Taking this into account, who then is responsible for the acts of war committed during wartime? Or better yet, who is responsible for initiating the war? Is it the big boss (Mr. H.) handing out the orders, or are you yourself always accountable for your own behavior, no matter the circumstances? \r\n\r\nMy point is, I think, that accountability of large scale aggressive attacks, whether cyber or 'in the flesh', was already a very complicated matter before digitalization of the world.\r\n\r\nAnyway, nice topic! I'm a big fan of your essays."
