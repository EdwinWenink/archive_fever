  Great philosophical questions you're laying out here. I'm trying to answer
  your question for myself that struck me the most: "And why do many people,
  including me, associate this reduction of work with a loss of status and
  ambition?". It seems like the serotonin circuits in our brains regulate the
  positive response we get from our peers when they appreciate our work in such
  a way that our psyche moulds our identity accordingly. The result of this
  positive response is more motivation that causes more work to be done which
  results in a positive response etc. This loop seems a lot like addictive
  behaviour to be honest. Although the word addictive has negative connotations,
  this could also be perfectly fine behaviour depending on our value systems.
  When the needs of this loop aren't being met, probably due to the process of
  cultivation, the need for automation may be more imperative. After all the
  more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it. So if your
  identity partly is defined by the value that you're ought not to lose ambition
  and work ethos, you will avoid losing this.
