  I think you just laid bare the foundations of my work addication! I definitely
  think of (intellectual) work as part of my identity. In fact, you could see
  this whole website as a testimony to that. In the beginning of his essay,
  Bertrand Russell points at something similar (without references to serotonin
  of course), namely that he has "acquired a conscience which has kept me
  working hard down to the present moment. But although my conscience has
  controlled my actions, my opinions have undergone a revolution." That is, this
  work ethic is so engrained in who he is, that even though he now argues for
  the value of idleness, he still works equally hard ("down to the present
  moment").
