body: "Thanks for reading and responding! \r\n\r\nNot explaining ALS and Collaborative Filtering is indeed not exactly the intent of this blog, where I try to explain as much as possible. Nevertheless it was a conscious decision to not explain it in detail, because that would be a post in itself. On top of that, in line with my conclusion, for most people it's really not that necessary or interesting to know all the details. I know you are not one of those people, of course. For a more in-depth explanation, you can look [here](https://medium.com/radon-dev/als-implicit-collaborative-filtering-5ed653ba39fe). \r\n\r\nW.r.t. to the computing on a laptop... that's just a bit stupid. Not every student gets or has access to a cluster (most don't). For educational purposes it's also not absolutely necessary, and the playing field is more level if everyone just uses their own machines. Obviously, for any real project this is an absolute no-go! :-)"
