  @Alex I also think you can and should explain complicated things in clear
  language, and moreover that this is a true sign of understanding. In that
  regard, Feynman is an absolute genius of course, even though he claims himself
  that he is an average man that worked hard ... and in that regard I could have
  done a better job in this post. But don't underestimate the difficulty of
  making things easy :-)!
