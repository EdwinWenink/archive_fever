body: "Sounds like you're at the level where you can do useful things with what you know \U0001F64C. In the shallow 'you can get money for this' sense.\r\n\r\nCurious to see what you'll do.\r\n\r\nRegarding the article, this sadly seems to be the first that has bits that I as a layman can't follow. Specifically the collaborative filtering with ALS. That said, I'm impressed you managed to make everything else accessible even though I hadn't heard of most of these concepts. Quite the feat \U0001F44F.\r\n\r\nFinally, why run computationally intensive work on your laptop? It sounds like you could've done significantly better with more power. It's not what laptops are they're for and luckily for us compute power is cheap!"
