  Alan Watts is cool, I'll try to listen to your suggested lecture when I have
  time. Glad to hear that it inspired you! I'm not sure to what extent Morton's
  philosophy is a call to action though. The confusion pertains not so much to
  the content of what Morton said in the lecture, as to the question how hearing
  all this changes our attitude towards the ecological crisis and how we
  (should?) deal with it. Watch for example [this
  review](https://www.trouw.nl/groen/timothy-morton-geeft-de-mensheid-ecologische-psychotherapie~ae0087af/)
  of the book he published in 2018, which describes his approach as a sort of
  ecological psychotherapy that does not aim to change our behavior directly. As
  a result, we are sort of left behind with the confusion "What to do?". And as
  the review also says, we do not even know we can trust the therapist...
