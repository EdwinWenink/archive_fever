  Thank you very much, I would love to hear more about that connection! I have a
  weak spot for continental metaphysics that dares to dabble with math. At the
  same time of course, we always have to be suspicious of philosophers using
  some math theorem opportunistically for their own theories. But this inherent
  danger only makes it more exciting to me... :-)
