	<h1> Musical statistics </h1>
	<div>
		<p> 
		When I meet new people I often ask them about their music taste.
		At the same time, I still have trouble answering this question myself. 
		I often spin my music taste in a particular direction depending on the context of the conversation. But what is more honest than just listing the statistics of what I *actually* listen to?

		These musical statistics are generated automatically
		through interacting with the LastFM API. 
		See the scripts I wrote for this <a href="https://github.com/EdwinWenink/personal_website/tree/master/static/scripts">here</a>.

		Last week, I listened to these five artists the most: 
		<table id="weekly_artists" border="1">
			<thead> 
				<th> Artist </th>
				<th> Playcount </th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>

			</tbody>
		</table>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p> And this is the overall leaderboard: </p>

		<table id="artists" border="1">
			<thead> 
				<th> Artist </th>
				<th> Playcount </th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>

			</tbody>
		</table>
	</div>
