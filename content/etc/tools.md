I'm currently using two machines: a desktop running Windows and a ThinkPad T420 running [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/).
I have Windows installed from before I got familiar with Linux and I'd like to get rid of it, but I'm not mentally ready to make that step because some software I like (read: Elite Dangerous) does not run well on Linux.

The ThinkPad T420 is loved for being a laptop with a good keyboard. 
On my desktop, I use the tenkeyless Leopold FC 660M keyboard with blue cherry switches, alongside a cheap Verto Ergonomic mouse from Trust.

On Arch Linux, I used [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) for several years, but a while back I switched to [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and I like how simple and fast it is.
I kept tinkling with i3 and after a while got fed up with wasting time on this, and regressed into a bare bones setup with the default i3 status bar.
Since I was going bare bones anyways, I gave dwm a shot and ended up loving it.

I maintain my own [fork of dwm here](https://github.com/EdwinWenink/dwm/).
I use [urxvt](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/rxvt-unicode.html) as a terminal emulator, in which I run the [Z shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) with some plugins from [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

I do most my work from within Vim, although I'm not being a dick about it.
Because the rest of the world does not always share my philosophy, I usually write in Vim and then convert my work to whatever file format someone asks from me using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), which is a Swiss army knife I can't do without (I love it!).

If my main machine would run Linux, I'd use [neomutt](https://neomutt.org/) for mailing and [newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) daily instead of occasionally.

In case you care, you can find my [dotfiles here](https://github.com/EdwinWenink/.dotfiles).
