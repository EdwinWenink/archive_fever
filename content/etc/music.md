When I meet new people I often ask them about their music taste.
When people return the favor and ask me what I listen to, I often spin my music taste in a particular direction depending on the context of the conversation. But what is more honest than just listing what I *actually* listen to?
These musical statistics are generated automatically
through interacting with the LastFM API. 
See the scripts I wrote for this <a href="https://github.com/EdwinWenink/personal_website/tree/master/static/scripts">here</a>.

<p> Last week, I listened to these five artists the most: </p>

<table id="weekly_artists" border="1">
<thead> 
<th> Artist </th>
<th> Playcount </th>
</thead>
<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p> And this is the overall leaderboard: </p>
<table id="artists" border="1">

<th> Artist </th>
<th> Playcount </th>
</thead>
<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
