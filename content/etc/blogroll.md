# Linkage

This is a page where I store all kinds of links.<br>

It is not quite a classical blogroll, as this page also contains links to specific web pages.
Some links are here because I kept them open in a browser tab for too long, so I might not have read them carefully myself. 
I also bookmark stuff under [edwinwenink.xyz/microblog/](https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/microblog/), but those I have read for sure.
I do try to organize links, but it doesn't always work out. 
I collect links for finding more links under "Tiny Directories and Blogrolls," if you want to go through hyperspace.

Intended to be permanently under construction.

	* "I've come to believe that a lot of what's wrong with the Internet has to do with memory. The Internet somehow contrives to remember too much and too little at the same time, and it maps poorly on our concepts of how memory should work."

Not to be confused with miscellaneous.
These are *really quite random*.
