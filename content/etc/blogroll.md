# Linkage

This is a page where I store all kinds of links.<br>

It is not quite a classical blogroll, as this page also contains links to specific web pages.
Some links are here because I kept them open in a browser tab for too long, so I might not have read them carefully myself. 
I also bookmark stuff under [edwinwenink.xyz/microblog/](https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/microblog/), but those I have read for sure.
I do try to organize links, but it doesn't always work out. 
I collect links for finding more links under "Tiny Directories and Blogrolls," if you want to go through hyperspace.

Intended to be permanently under construction.
