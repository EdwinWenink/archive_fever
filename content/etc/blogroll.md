Beware: links are stored here.
Some links have lived here for so long, they started to rot.
That's a shame but part of life on the internet.

If you look closely the URL mentions something about a blogroll, but that's not quite accurate, is it now?

Some links are here because I kept them open in a browser tab for too long, so I might not have read them carefully myself. 
Neither do I necessarily endorse whatever is listed on these pages, deal with it!
I also bookmark stuff under [edwinwenink.xyz/microblog/](https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/microblog/), but those I have read for sure.

I do more or less try to organize links - it's a futile effort, one may call it Archive Fever - but it doesn't always work out. 
The order of links has no significance.
That's OK.

I collect links for finding more links under "Tiny Directories and Blogrolls," if you want to go through hyperspace.

Intended to be permanently under construction.
