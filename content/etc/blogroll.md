# Blogroll

This is a page where I store all kinds of links.<br>
Intended to be permanently under construction.

## Philosophy

- [De Klos](https://deklos.wordpress.com/): blog of my friend Boris on the challenges of the Antrophocene
- [Conscious Entities](http://www.consciousentities.com): casual blog for some late-night philosophy, with a nice clean look. 

## AI / Programming 

- [Calling Bullshit: Data Reasoning in a Digital World](https://callingbullshit.org/index.html)


## Miscellaneous

- [Collection of canonical short texts, mostly on (cyber)culture](https://urbigenous.net/library/).

## Random

Not to be confused with miscellaneous.
These are *really quite random*.

- [Q: What is the connection between goats and Justin Bieber?](https://www.geitjesenbieber.xyz) <br> A: My friend [Joran](https://www.joranwelling.nl/) apparently promised to make a website about them.
