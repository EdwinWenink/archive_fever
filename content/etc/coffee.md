`def` philosopher: a machine for turning coffee into thoughts.

A taster of witty coffee-induced literature, [The Pleasures and Pains of Coffee](https://urbigenous.net/library/pleasures_pains_coffee.html), by Honor√© de Balzac:

> "On this subject Brillat-Savarin is far from complete.
I can add something to what he has said because coffee is a great power in my life; I have observed its effects on an epic scale.
Coffee roasts your insides.
Many people claim coffee inspires them; but as everybody likewise knows, coffee only makes boring people even more boring.
Think about it: although more grocery stores are staying open in Paris until midnight, few writers are actually becoming more spiritual."


I have a few ways to make coffee at home:


- Simple filter coffee machine
	* My first machine got so hot it burns the coffee and made my coffee pot explode
- Bodum pour over coffee
- Mokka Express (3 persons)
- Old Krups Espresso machine


I grind coffee using the Baratza Encore Esp, because it can grind coffee for espresso to filter to pour over.


I tend to make filter coffee with medium roasted espresso beans, but then overdo the amount of beans.
