First of all, read: [The Pleasures and Pains of Coffee](https://urbigenous.net/library/pleasures_pains_coffee.html), by Honoré de Balzac.

A first taster of witty coffee-induced literature:

"On this subject Brillat-Savarin is far from complete. 
I can add something to what he has said because coffee is a great power in my life; I have observed its effects on an epic scale. 
Coffee roasts your insides. 
Many people claim coffee inspires them; but as everybody likewise knows, coffee only makes boring people even more boring. 
Think about it: although more grocery stores are staying open in Paris until midnight, few writers are actually becoming more spiritual."

## Coffeemakers

- Simple filter coffee machine
	* Get's so hot it burns the coffee
	* Also made my coffee pot explode
	* Coffee for people with a strong will
- Bodum pour over coffee
- Mokka Express (3 persons)
- Old Krups Espresso machine

I threw away two Senseo machines I owned, because I am not convinced anymore they actually produce coffee.

## Coffee I tried

@Simon Lévelt

- Espresso Milano
- Espresso Corleone
