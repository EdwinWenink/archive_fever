# My Plants 

This is a list of plants I own or owned. 
One could say this hobby got out of hand.
All these plants live in a single student room, so it's quite... cozy.

## Araceae

Watching these type of plants create new leaves from a spadix and sometimes a spathe will never bore me.

- Alocasia 'Portodora' ("Elephant's Ear")
    * Very big, hence the elephant reference
- Spathiphyllum
- Dieffenbachia

### Climbing Varieties

- Monstera Deliciosa (huge!)
- Philodendron Cordatum ("Heart Leaf Philodendron")
    * Or... philodendron hederaceum, haven't found the difference yet
- Philodendron Scandens 'Brasil' (variegated)
- Philodendron Squamiferum Hybrid
- Scindapsus Pictus 
- Epipremnum Aureum 

## Marantaceae

Definitely another favorite group.
Their leaves dance and sing.

- Maranta leuconeura var. erythroneura 
- Calathea Ornata
- Calathea Lancifolia

## Trees / varia

- Pachira Aquatica
- Ficus Microcarpa Ginseng x3
- Lemon tree

## Strelitziacaea

- Strelitzia Nicolai
    * Lives permanently in water, so it grows slowly (that's a good thing, in this case)

## Urticaceae ("nettle family")

- Pilea Peperomioides x2 

## Asparagaceae

- Chlorophytum comosum ("Spider plant")

## Davalliaceae (a family of ferns)

- Davallia fejeensis
    * Also called Rabbit's Foot Fern, because the leaves grow from wooly rhizomes that hang out the pot

## Succulents

- Aloe Vera x2 (specific type unknown)
- Sanseveria Black Coral
- Crassula Portulacea x2 ("Jade tree")

## Cactii

- Cereus Validus Spiralis
- Several unidentified small cactii

As you can see most of these plants are succulents, which are supposed to be easy, but aren't for me.
I have mediocre light conditions with a northern / slightly eastern window. 
I try to water succulents as little as possible, but when I do, they tend to not dry quick enough with the risk of root rot, due to the lack of sun and the low growth rate in these conditions.
For example, in full sun during summer, I could water the Senecio's as often as 2-3 times per week. But once the sun stopped shining, the plants immediately got into trouble, even if I stopped watering immediately.

The hedera I found to be too susceptible to lice, so I had to get rid of it to spare my other plants.
