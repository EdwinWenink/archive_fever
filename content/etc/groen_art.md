TLDR: my mother makes paintings and sells some of them.

Over the years she painted in various styles, both abstract and concrete. 
But irregardless of the style, her paintings are usually inspired by nature.
I particularly like her most recent works in which she developed a recognizable style: very colorful abstractions of natural subjects, mainly trees and some of her favorite animals (but not *too* abstract). 

She also works on commission. If you like what you see and are interested, I can bring you into contact with her, or you can visit [her web site](http://www.groen-art.nl) (Dutch).

Here are some of my personal favorites.

## Colorful and abstract trees:
