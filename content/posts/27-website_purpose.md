I largely quit social media because it transferred from being a medium that helped me keep in touch with people and that stimulated social interaction, to a endless stream of promoted clickbait content. 
The little "real" personal content that made it to my feed, was usually dull and did not facilitate any interesting conversations.
With the creation of this website I'm trying to take control of my online identity, making this domain a main hub for various dispersed identities, somewhat along the lines of [these principles](https://indieweb.org/).

Being free to do with this website what I want in a way that is meaningful for me, gives me joy.
In addition, this website really is personal because I built it myself, which comes with a sense of pride (in the positive sense of the word).
It is my first website, and I had no idea what I was doing when I started out.
I had never written any html or css, but with the help of a friend during a nightly Skype-session (during which he fell asleep) I had a very simple one page site online within a few days.
It was really, really bad. 
But it was out there, and it was mine. 
Over time I kept incrementally improving on it bit by bit, and by now I've reached a point where I'm quite content with the websites' features and its minimalistic look (although I'm constantly fighting the urge to delete almost all css and go barebones). 

By now, I find myself stimulating others to make their own personal website, and helping them out in the process.
Over the last weeks, I helped my friend Boris make his own website. 
He had a Wordpress blog, but wanted to get rid of the generic themes, unnecessary bells and whistles, advertisements, the ugly URL, and in general just wanted to be in full control of his own content. 
Of course some of those problems would have been solved by a paid subscription, which is fair enough.
But for his purposes, a more minimalistic website sufficed with no extra costs. 
Even if it is a bit robust in the beginning, it has more charm because it is *authentic*.
I know that for the average philosopher all hands-on tech stuff is, well... 
Let's just say they like *thinking* about technology more than using it.
If you keep your website simple enough however, you can learn to maintain it yourself, *even* if you are a philosopher. 
Apart from that, I really like Boris as a person and as a philosopher so I was glad to help him.
His work and thoughts are interesting and deserve a cool website.
Everyone needs some help starting up, and I'm sure Boris will help someone else at some point.
He published his new website last week, and I'm convinced it's the beginning of a nice digital journey where a lot will be learned.

The bottom-line is: what makes this website personal for me is not that it contains personal content, but that it is way more effective in creating *real interaction* with people than so-called "social media".
This interaction is *meaningful* for me, whereas a major portion of other online activity can feel like a waste of time.
This website helps me formulate thoughts, be more creative, more productive, stimulates nice discussion amongst my friends, reinforces existing relationships, and perhaps helps making new ones.
In that spirit, I want to offer digital residence to friends on my domain.
The point of my blogs is to formulate thoughts on my own interests, but in such a way that they enable dialogue with other people.
I play with the idea to spark more dialogue by allowing others to post on this domain as well.
I do not yet completely know how this will work out, but my current experimental idea is this:

1. Friends/acquaintances can write a post on a topic reflecting a shared interest. My interests are very broad, so finding such a common interest should be easy.
2. I will publish the post, unless I consider it completely unsuitable to be associated with my name.
3. My role in the process ranges somewhere between a minimal form of redaction, and full cooperation in writing the post.
4. In return, each contributor gets their own home page on this domain. This homepage lists all their contributions, and apart from that they are free to do with it as they please. (Technically, this amounts to giving them their own branch on the Github repo of this site)

I made an example of such a homepage [here](https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/~guest/).

As for the content of the blogs themselves, I consider them to be an exercise in imperfection.
They are not as unstructured as notes, but neither are they fully developed like articles. 
They are somewhere in between, more like *essays* in their original sense: they are *attempts*, exercises in writing and thinking that do not shy away from incompleteness.
It's yet another reason why I like to think of them in terms of a dialogue: in real conversations answers are not known in advance; they can be confused, open-ended.
It is no coincidence that blog writing has such a *conversational* style.
It reflects thinking *on-the-way* (yes, that is a reference to Heidegger), and in one sense it is a text that ideally does not want to be written down. 
Its conversational style is a resistance to the suggestion of completeness that accompanies writing, and tries to be *spoken* language: a voice amongst other voices.

For me personally, perfectionism has in the past prevented me from daring to publish or submit anything. 
These blog posts are a good exercise in *letting go*.
I write them as quick as possible and then immediately publish them, to avoid that they stay on the shelf. 
There is another bonus: I have struggled the last years with formulating the *relevance* of philosophy. 
After starting a second university education, I have come to the belief that philosophy is at its best when it does not only engage with other philosophers, but (also) works from within another discipline, shaping and enriching it from within. 
I hope that as this blog develops, it will be a testimony to this thought.
