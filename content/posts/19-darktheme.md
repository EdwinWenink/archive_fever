Two short updates: 

1) I designed a minimalistic "Dark Theme" for this website. It can be selected in two ways. If your browser supports it, you can manually select the page layout. For example, in Firefox you can press Alt -> View -> Page style -> Dark theme. However, this makes the selection only for the current page. I added some Javascript to save your preference for one session only in a cookie, so that your preference sticks as you navigate to other pages of this website. The cookie becomes unaffected once you close your browser. The code I use for this is a bit crude currently, but I'll improve it over time.

2) Since I started this website, I have had "etc" on the landing page. 
But only now have I actually made an "etc" header, under which I will collect miscellaneous pages. Check it out!
