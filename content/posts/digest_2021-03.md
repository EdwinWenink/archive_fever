Bill Callahan has been releasing a lot of new stuff recently, also together with Bonnie Prince Billy (which is my most listened to artist of all time).
Some of it is pretty weird too. 
Most of it, actually.
Of the recent stuff this is one of my favorites:

But mostly, Bill Callahan popping up on the radar again was a great excuse to listen to tried and tested favorites.
I particularly love Drover:

Floating Points *just* dropped an album with Pharaoh Sanders and the London Symphony Orchestra.
Check out Movement 1.

One of my favorite bands produced two back-to-back albums, revisiting their previous microtonal work.
Psychedelic grooves meeting the East.

From K.G. (late 2020):

King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard finished the series (K.G.L.W.) this year with L.W. which is awesome from beginning to end!

I knew Mark Lanegan from his work with Queens of the Stone Age, but somehow I never listened to his other work. 
My bad!

Chick Corea passed away, so a tribute is in place. 
Here is a live rendition of Crystal Silence, together with Gary Burton.

When reviewing my top artists from 2020 Yves Tumor popped up in there, even though I didn't really know this artist.
I'm glad I do now, I'm hooked.
