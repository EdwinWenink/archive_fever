I've spend quite some time on 

deconstruction... etc.

Deconstruction is not incompatible with a desire for truth;
it's just that this desire will be more tragic.
We experience the inevitability of the strive and impossibility of what we strive for all at once.

in fact, I find that the more honest metaphysician will likely experience a deconstruction of sorts.
In the very attempt to capture 


love truth so hard you have to sacrifice your own hopes for it, in the name of truth

Even in the most beautifully built cathedral there will be cracks in the walls that show lines of flight.
They open up onto an exteriority that has been purposefully kept outside of the walls in order to maintain its integrity.
A classic metaphysician is trying to build a conception of the real like such a cathedral. 
The higher beings reside in the towers, the lower beings grovel in the basement.

Deconstruction is something that almost happens by itself.
If you leave the cathedral to itself, more cracks will show and vines from the wilderness outside will start to creep up and enter through them.
Deconstruction is not entirely unlike entropy, but it's not simply an exercise of applying chaotic force as well.
The deconstructive thinker rather comes along, looks at the neatly structured reality of the cathedral interior, realizes it's been built on the negative space of the outside, and then points out that the outside (which was included in thought only as the "not inside" the cathedral) was already inside all along; and in fact, the cathedral could not have been built without it.
We can guard 

Deconstruction does not point to this instability as a construction error (this would be perfectly fine as a metaphysician response: "We can do better. Let's fix the building!"), but as an inevitability in the project of construction itself.
Deconstruction as a style of thought does not say "Let chaos take over! Everything is relative! Truth is a lie, we should destroy it!" etc.
It indeed is an subversive act against the pretenses of cathedral-builders and the interiority and supposed self-sameness of their conception of reality;
yet we can still perfectly fine enjoy the beauty of the cathedral. 
It's just that everything has become more fragile, contingent, less simple. 
But there's beauty in contingency. 
We'll take our chances.


the best works of Derrida makes me experience this; his more derivative work (derivative of his own more original works, mostly) feel like indeed he is applying a trick, more lazily reapplying points "made elsewhere already".
