This is the blog of Edwin Wenink, a student of philosophy and artificial intelligence. 

I intend to use this blog as a mnemonic device.
Over the years I have occupied myself with studying such [diverse topics](https://edwinwenink.xyz/courses.html), only to realize that I can barely recollect half of it.
So as a rule of thumb for this blog: if I spend a considerable amount of time on one topic, I should record it in this elaborate and weirdly public note-taking system.
My best guess at the moment is that those notes are likely to be related     either to philosophy, artificial intelligence, or the ongoing discovery of (Arch) Linux and the design of a nice workflow.
What emerges over time is hopefully a rhizomatic collection of interesting notes, where no one (including me) really has a central oversight on the contents, where there is no category table assigning everything its proper place, but where posts branch out and interlink chaos-logically. This is reflected in the only "searchable‚Äù feature of this blog: clicking on the tag of a blogpost shows you posts with the same tag.
